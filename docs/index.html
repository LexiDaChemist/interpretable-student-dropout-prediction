        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      </div>

      <p class="caption">
        This project predicts student outcomes (Dropout, Enrolled, Graduate) using academic progress, financial indicators,
        demographic information, and economic context. The main focus is interpretability: the goal is to understand
        <em>which factors push predictions up or down</em>, not just to get a score.
      </p>

      <p class="caption">
        I chose this topic because dropout is a real problem for students and institutions. A model like this can support
        early outreach (advising, tutoring, financial support) when used responsibly.
      </p>

    <!-- 2) Model -->

        <h2>Learning Model Used</h2>
        <span class="pill">Logistic regression</span>
      </div>

      <p class="caption">
        A multiclass <strong>logistic regression</strong> model because it estimates the probability of each outcome class
        using a weighted combination of input features. This makes it a strong choice for interpretability because data can be
        inspected by each of the learned weights to explain the predictions.
      </p>

      <p class="small-note">
        <strong>Why not a more complex model?</strong>
        Models like boosted trees can be powerful, but they can be harder to explain. Here, a simplistic interpretation is the core
        requirement, so logistic regression is a better fit.
      </p>

      <p class="small-note">
        <strong>What the model uses:</strong>
        academic progress (curricular units enrolled/approved across semesters), financial indicators (debtor status, tuition
        fees up to date, scholarship holder), demographics (gender, marital status, displaced/international status), and
        context (unemployment rate).

        <h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
        <span class="pill">Confusion matrix + Metrics</span>
      </div>

      <p class="caption">
        The confusion matrix compares each student’s <strong>true outcome</strong> (what happened) to the model’s
        <strong>predicted outcome</strong>. Rows are actual labels; columns are predicted labels. The diagonal shows correct
        predictions, and off-diagonal cells show mistakes (where one outcome is confused for another).
      </p>

      <p class="small-note">
        <strong>What it is (and isn’t) comparing:</strong> <br>
        This matrix compares outcomes vs predicted outcomes. It does not compare individual features (like age or gender)
        directly. Features affect predictions, but the matrix only counts whether predictions match the true outcome.
      </p>

      <p class="small-note">
        <strong>TP / FP / FN / TN and the confusion matrix:</strong> <br>
        In a multiclass problem like Dropout, Enrolled, and Graduate, these terms are defined one class at a time
        using a “one-vs-rest” view. For example, when focusing on <em>Dropout</em>, a <strong>true positive</strong>
        is a student who actually dropped out and was predicted as Dropout. A <strong>false positive</strong> is
        predicted as Dropout but stayed enrolled or graduated, while a <strong>false negative</strong> is a true
        dropout predicted as something else. A <strong>true negative</strong> is a non-dropout correctly predicted
        as non-dropout. In the confusion matrix, rows represent the true outcomes and columns represent the model’s
        predictions. The <em>diagonal cells</em> show correct predictions, while the <em>off-diagonal cells</em>
        show errors where one outcome is confused for another. Metrics like precision and recall summarize these
        patterns across the dataset.
      </p>

      <p class="small-note">
        <strong>Why use a confusion matrix?</strong> <br>
        Accuracy alone can hide which classes are being confused. The confusion matrix shows the exact error pattern, which is
        especially important for three outcomes.

        This project shows how an interpretable model can support education outcomes research. The main value is not just
        prediction, but a clear view into which factors are linked to dropout risk and student success.

      <p class="caption">
        In the real world, a tool like this could help guide supportive interventions (advising, tutoring, financial outreach).
        Because the data is observational, these results are associations, not causal claims, and fairness checks are important
        before deployment.
